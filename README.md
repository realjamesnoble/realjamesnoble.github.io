# About me

I am currently a university student studying under the Modern Japanese Studies Program at Hokkaido University. I wish to further my study into the socio-political affairs of the Tokugawa period (Edo period). Furthermore, I also wish to research the long-term changes of the Japanese language, mainly through the means of increased trade/interaction with the wider world. 

I am an avid enjoyer of Australian football (AFL) and the UFC. As I have family on the professional scene, I also enjoy watching the odd game of cricket.

A long-term goal of mine is to eventually travel through all the prefectures of Japan, with particular focus on Shikoku and the *shikoku henro* (Shikoku pilgrimage). During these travels, regular stops to local breweries - sake or otherwise - will hopefully be a regular occurance.
